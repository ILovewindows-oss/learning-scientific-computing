# Ideas for new notebooks

- Using a procedure as developed in [002-Teaching-MPC-Through-PSR-Python.ipynb](002-Teaching-MPC-Through-PSR-Python.ipynb) generate time-series data of system dynamics under several configurations (multiple types of transitions, maybe with varying reaction constant or reactor volume). Using the generated data, use an algorithm as LSTM to learn the automation with machine learning.
