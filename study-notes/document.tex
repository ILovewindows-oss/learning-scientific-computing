\begin{abstract}
	This document has no specific or fixed structure. It is intended to be a single place to group study notes and short discussions about papers and books so that they can be reused later \emph{i.e.} to give a lecture or as reminder for a review for a paper. Please do not rely on this document as a perennial source or as a source of truth since there is no reviewer checking it to date.
