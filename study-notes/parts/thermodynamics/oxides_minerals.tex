\subsection{Oxide systems for minerals}

\textcite{Huang1995} provide an assessment of \ch{CaO - MgO - SiO2} system at atmospheric pressure. The authors make use of a two-sublattice model for ionic liquid since it presents ions of different charges, and solid phases as ionic compounds with oxygen as anion and metals representing the cations. This can be achieved through an extension of \emph{compound energy model}.
