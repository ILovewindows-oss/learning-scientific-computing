## Useful flags

- `-p` for playing the animation once rendering is over
- `-f` for opening the output directory once rendering is over
- `-ql` for rendering low quality output (useful for debugging)
- `-qh` for rendering high quality output (recommended for production)
- `--format=` can be used to set a non-default output as `gif`
- `--save_sections` to save output videos of indidual sections

## Cleaning up

To clean all subdirectories (because it generates at lot of data) run:

```bash
rm -rf **/media
```

Take care with this command, misuse can be disastrous!
