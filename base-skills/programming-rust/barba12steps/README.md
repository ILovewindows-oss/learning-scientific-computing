# Relecture of Barba's 12 steps to Navier-Stokes in Rust

This is a self-learning study of Rust based on [CFDPython](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython), previously known as 12 steps to Navier-Stokes as documented [here](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00021).

It is not intended to be a faithful translation, but an adaptation for learning how to implement numerical problems in Rust.
