# Code Saturn Tutorials

This is a relecture of the original [tutorials](https://github.com/code-saturne/saturne-tutorials) provided by [code_saturn](https://www.code-saturne.org/cms/web/) and unless you know what you are doing, you should be use the original documents. My intent here is to learn `code_saturn`, add some post-processing, and validate its use to some applications of interest. For reference, all tutorials where tested under version 7.1.1, although that might not exaclty correspond to the files under [pdf](pdf) directory.

Please notice that the license of the [original repository](https://github.com/code-saturne/saturne-tutorials) overwrites any license stated in this repository, since it is not managed as a fork.
