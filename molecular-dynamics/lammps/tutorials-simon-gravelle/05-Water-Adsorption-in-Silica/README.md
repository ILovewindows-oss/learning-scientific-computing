# Osmosis through a rigid membrane

This is a relecture of [this](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/tutorials/05-FluidCrack.html) tutorial. It has been decomposed in the following files:

- [input-step-1.lammps](input-step-1.lammps) provides the creation of an amorphous silica block.

- [input-step-2.lammps](input-step-2.lammps) provides the cracking of the silica block.

- [input-step-3.lammps](input-step-3.lammps) uses GCMC simulation to add water to cracks in silica.
