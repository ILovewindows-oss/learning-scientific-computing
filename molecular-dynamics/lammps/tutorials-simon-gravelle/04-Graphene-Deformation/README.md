# Osmosis through a rigid membrane

This is a relecture of [this](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/tutorials/04-Graphene.html) tutorial. It has been decomposed in the following files:

- [input-step-1.lammps](input-step-1.lammps) provides the simulation of a graphene sheet deformation.

- [input-step-2.lammps](input-step-2.lammps) provides the simulation of a carbon nanotube rupture.
