# Kratos Multiphysics

- [Input Files and IO](01-Input-Files-and-IO): this is a reconstruction of the tutorial initially found [here](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Kratos-input-files-and-IO). One may notice that the original source is not up-to-date with current version of Kratos Multiphysics and some reworking was required in order for it to run.
