# Kratos Multiphysics

Notice that before starting here you are recommended to check the [tutorial](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Python-Tutorials). One important point for exporting complex meshes from other tools (thus requiring to add new variables for the solution, ...) is the manipulation as descriped [here](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Python-Script-Tutorial:-Reading-ModelPart-From-Input-File).

Here you will find the following tutorials/cases in Python:

- [Input Files and IO](02-Input-Files-and-IO): this is a reconstruction of the tutorial initially found [here](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Kratos-input-files-and-IO). One may notice that the original source is not up-to-date with current version of Kratos Multiphysics and some reworking was required in order for it to run.


Once you have mastered Python API, it is recommended to follow the [full C++/Python tutorial for dummies](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Kratos-For-Dummies:-Stationary-heat-transfer) tutorial. It is intended to be a first contact with FEM and the use of Kratos at lower level and development.
